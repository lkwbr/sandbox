# Sandbox
Place for me to burry myself and build stuff. Here will go anything from small ideas I want to experiment with, to coding questions I'm working on.

#### ProbabilityOfAlive
Given an initial postiion on an NxN island, n steps to be taken, and an (x, y) coordinate, the probability that you will be alive is computed and displayed to your console.

| Symbol        | Meaning          |
| ------------- |------------------|
| \|            | untreked land    |
| _             | reachable land   |
| ^             | current location |
