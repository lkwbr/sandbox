# Sandbox
Place for me to burry myself and build stuff. Here will go anything of the following, among other miscellaneous things:
* Small ideas to toy with,
* Subcomponents of larger projects, and
* Interview questions.

#### ProbabilityOfAlive
Given an initial postiion on an NxN island, n steps to be taken, and an (x, y) coordinate, the probability that you will be alive is computed and displayed to your console.
